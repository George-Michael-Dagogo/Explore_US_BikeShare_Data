# Bikeshare Data Analysis and Presentation
The data sets were too large to be uploaded to github.
This project was done with the sole purpose of filtering and presenting the data to the end user by the end user.
Project completed as team work at the end of Wejapa data science internship.

A web application was also created to make the data filtering more interactive.
